- Extract and preserve requirement language ("must", "shall", "required") with legal precision
- Handle existing tracked changes (9 modifications) while adding new ones
- Maintain legal document structure and formatting for enforceability
- Combine fallback requirements with user input intelligently
- Support documents with 215+ content paragraphs and complex cross-references

## Key Technical Requirements (Based on Fallback Document Analysis)

- **Hierarchical Structure**: Support numbered sections (1.1, 1.2, 2.1, etc.)
- **Legal Language**: Preserve exact requirement language (48 "shall" instances, 4 "must" instances)
- **Tracked Changes**: Handle existing modifications by multiple authors with timestamps
- **Formatting Preservation**: Maintain 122 bold segments, 15 underlined segments, 4 italic segments
- **Cross-References**: Preserve 119 parenthetical notes and legal definitions

### Content Processing Requirements
- **Requirements Extraction**: Identify 102+ requirement mentions across document
- **Prohibition Handling**: Process 13 restriction instances ("shall not", "must not")
- **Section Management**: Handle 60 main contract clauses with subsections
- **Payment Terms**: Process complex financial terms and budget schedules
