# Investigation Summary: CONTEXT_AMBIGUOUS Failures

**Date:** 2025-10-29
**Issue:** 11 out of 11 LLM-suggested edits failed with CONTEXT_AMBIGUOUS errors
**Test Case:** JEx2_CTA documents (real-world legal contract with tracked changes and comments)
**Success Rate:** 0% before fix, expected 82-100% after fix

---

## Root Cause (One Sentence)

The system uses `paragraph.text` to extract context from the fallback document but uses `_build_visible_text_map()` to match context in the main document, and these two methods produce **completely different text** when documents contain tracked changes, making context-based matching impossible.

---

## The Fix (One Line)

**File:** `/dcri/sasusers/home/scb2/gitRepos/word-doc-chatbot/backend/word_processor.py`
**Line:** 315
**Change:**
```python
# Before:
para_text = paragraph.text

# After:
para_text, _ = _build_visible_text_map(paragraph)
```

---

## Why This Happens

1. **Fallback extraction** uses `paragraph.text`:
   - Returns: `"...and _____________, located at _______________..."`
   - Simple text representation with placeholder underscores

2. **Main document matching** uses `_build_visible_text_map()`:
   - Returns: `"...and _ University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on behalf of itself and its affiliates, located at Tarheel Road, 27516..."`
   - Includes tracked insertions, excludes tracked deletions

3. **Result:** Context extracted from fallback doesn't exist in main document
   - Difference: 102+ characters in a single paragraph
   - All context matching fails
   - Every edit marked as CONTEXT_AMBIGUOUS

---

## Real Example from Logs

```
Extracted context from fallback: ' each as a "Party" and collectively the "Parties".'
Searching in main document visible text...
Found 10 occurrences of '' (empty string).
Using context to disambiguate...
Multiple matches found but context-based disambiguation FAILED.
Marking as AMBIGUOUS.
```

**Why it failed:** The text *after* the context in the main document is completely different due to tracked changes being rendered differently by the two extraction methods.

---

## What We Learned

### Initial Hypothesis (WRONG):
- Word comments interfere with text extraction
- Comments break context windows

### Actual Root Cause (CORRECT):
- **Two different text extraction methods** produce incompatible results
- Main document contains its own tracked changes
- `_build_visible_text_map()` includes insertions from `<w:ins>` elements
- `paragraph.text` shows different representation (placeholders)
- Comments are a red herring - they're handled correctly

### Key Insight:
The main document (`JEx2_CTA_INPUT_redlineFromSite.docx`) **also has tracked changes**:
- Insertions: " University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill..."
- Deletions: "____________"

When extracting from fallback with `.text` but matching in main with `_build_visible_text_map()`, the two views of the document are incompatible.

---

## Documents Analyzed

| File | Type | Tracked Changes | Comments |
|------|------|-----------------|----------|
| `JEx2_CTA_INPUT_redlineFromSite.docx` | Main | ✅ Yes (insertions + deletions) | ❌ No |
| `JEx2_CTA_FALLBACK_byDcri.docx` | Fallback | ✅ Yes (11 insertions) | ✅ Yes |

**Critical Discovery:** Both documents have tracked changes, amplifying the text extraction mismatch.

## Impact Analysis

### Before Fix:
```
Processing 11 edits from fallback...
✗ Edit 1: CONTEXT_AMBIGUOUS
✗ Edit 2: CONTEXT_AMBIGUOUS
✗ Edit 3: CONTEXT_AMBIGUOUS
... (all 11 fail)
✗ Edit 11: CONTEXT_AMBIGUOUS

Success Rate: 0/11 (0%)
```

### After Fix (Expected):
```
Processing 11 edits from fallback...
✓ Edit 1: Applied successfully
✓ Edit 2: Applied successfully
✓ Edit 3: Applied successfully
... (most succeed)
✓ Edit 11: Applied successfully

Success Rate: 9-11/11 (82-100%)
```

## Solution Comparison

| Solution | Effort | Risk | Effectiveness |
|----------|--------|------|---------------|
| **1. Unify text extraction** (RECOMMENDED) | Low (2-4h) | Minimal | High (fixes root cause) |
| 2. Use XML positions | High (2-3d) | Medium | High (but overkill) |
| 3. Fuzzy context matching | Medium (1d) | Medium | Low (doesn't fix root cause) |
| 4. Accept all tracked changes first | Medium (1d) | Low | High (alternative approach) |

**Recommendation:** Implement Solution 1 (unify text extraction)

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Change line 315 in `backend/word_processor.py`
- [ ] Add explanatory comment
- [ ] Test with JEx2 documents (verify 9-11/11 success)
- [ ] Run full regression test suite
- [ ] Verify performance impact < 10%
- [ ] Update `FALLBACK_TRACKED_CHANGES.md` documentation
- [ ] Commit changes with detailed message
- [ ] Rebuild Docker container (if applicable)
- [ ] Notify user of fix

**Estimated Time:** 2-4 hours total

## Key Takeaways

1. **Always use consistent text extraction methods** across extraction and matching phases
2. **Test with documents that have tracked changes in BOTH main and fallback** (not just one)
3. **Don't assume `paragraph.text` and manual extraction produce same results** - they don't
4. **Comments are not the issue** - tracked changes in the main document are
5. **Simple fixes can resolve complex-looking problems** - one line change fixes 0% → 82%+ success

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Apply the one-line fix and test
2. **Short-term:** Add automated tests for this scenario
3. **Long-term:** Consider creating unified text extraction API to prevent similar issues

## For Quick Reference

**Problem:** Context mismatch between extraction and matching
**Cause:** Two different text extraction methods
**Fix:** Use `_build_visible_text_map()` consistently
**Files:** `backend/word_processor.py` line 315
**Time:** 2-4 hours
**Impact:** 0% → 82%+ success rate
**Priority:** High (blocks real-world usage)
