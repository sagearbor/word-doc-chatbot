# Implementation Summary

This document summarizes all changes made to implement three major features for the Word Document Chatbot application.

## Overview

Three separate feature branches were created off `dev`, each implementing a major feature:

1. **feat/nginx-config**: NGINX reverse proxy configuration for deployment at https://aidemo.dcri.duke.edu/sageapp04/
2. **feat/docker-deployment**: Docker deployment support for local development and Azure Web App deployment
3. **feat/fallback-tracked-changes**: Fallback document with tracked changes extraction and application

All three branches have been merged back to `dev` successfully.

---

## Feature 1: NGINX Reverse Proxy Configuration

**Branch**: `feat/nginx-config`
**Status**: ✅ Merged to dev

### Problem Solved

Enable the application (running on port 3004) to be accessible at https://aidemo.dcri.duke.edu/sageapp04/ via NGINX reverse proxy, handling both current path-stripping behavior and potential future configuration changes.

### Files Created

1. **frontend/.streamlit/config.toml**
   - Streamlit server configuration for reverse proxy
   - Disables CORS, XSRF protection, WebSocket compression
   - Required for proper operation behind reverse proxy

2. **frontend/entrypoint.sh**
   - Dynamic Streamlit startup script
   - Configures `baseUrlPath` from `BASE_URL_PATH` environment variable
   - Makes container adaptable to different deployment paths

3. **nginx-helper.conf**
   - Standalone NGINX configuration
   - Restores `/sageapp04` path prefix after main NGINX strips it
   - Proxies to Streamlit on localhost:8501
   - Includes TRAILING_SLASH_CHANGE comments

4. **nginx-helper-docker.conf**
   - Docker-specific version using service names
   - Proxies to `http://frontend:8501` instead of localhost
   - Identical functionality to nginx-helper.conf

5. **NGINX_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md**
   - Comprehensive 550+ line deployment guide
   - Covers multiple deployment scenarios
   - Explains trailing slash behavior
   - Includes migration guide for NGINX configuration changes
   - Quick reference commands

### Files Modified

1. **.env.example**
   - Added `BASE_URL_PATH` documentation
   - Explains when and how to set path prefix

### Key Technical Decisions

- **nginx-helper pattern**: Used lightweight NGINX container to restore path prefix
- **Conditional path prefix**: Streamlit only adds baseUrlPath when `BASE_URL_PATH` is set
- **TRAILING_SLASH_CHANGE comments**: Added to all relevant files for easy maintenance
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Single guide covering all scenarios

### What to Do Next

1. **Test on VM**:
   ```bash
   # Set the base path for reverse proxy
   export BASE_URL_PATH=/sageapp04

   # Start nginx-helper container
   docker run -d -p 3004:80 \
     -v $(pwd)/nginx-helper.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf \
     nginx:alpine

   # Start Streamlit (will pick up BASE_URL_PATH)
   ./frontend/entrypoint.sh
   ```

2. **Verify Access**: Navigate to https://aidemo.dcri.duke.edu/sageapp04/

3. **If IT Changes NGINX**: Follow the migration guide in NGINX_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md section "What If IT Removes the Trailing Slash?"

---

## Feature 2: Docker Deployment

**Branch**: `feat/docker-deployment`
**Status**: ✅ Merged to dev

### Problem Solved

Make the application deployable via Docker for:
- Local development and testing
- POC/demo environment on VM
- Production deployment to Azure Web App

### Files Created

1. **Dockerfile**
   - Multi-stage build with shared python-base
   - Backend target (port 8004)
   - Frontend target (port 8501) with entrypoint.sh
   - Optimized layer caching
   - Non-root user for security

2. **docker-compose.yml**
   - Three services: backend, frontend, nginx-helper
   - Health checks for all services
   - Shared network and volumes
   - Environment variable configuration
   - Extensive TRAILING_SLASH_CHANGE comments
   - Ready for production use

3. **.dockerignore**
   - Excludes unnecessary files from Docker context
   - Reduces build time and image size
   - Excludes venv, cache, tests, docs, deployment configs

4. **DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md**
   - 750+ line comprehensive deployment guide
   - Four deployment scenarios:
     - Local development
     - POC/demo on VM
     - Production VM deployment
     - Azure Web App deployment
   - Complete commands reference
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Security considerations

### Files Modified

None (all new files)

### Key Technical Decisions

- **Multi-stage build**: Separate backend and frontend targets in single Dockerfile
- **Health checks**: Ensures services are ready before accepting traffic
- **nginx-helper optional**: Can be removed if main NGINX changes (see TRAILING_SLASH_CHANGE comments)
- **Environment-based configuration**: All settings via environment variables
- **Security**: Non-root user, minimal base image

### What to Do Next

1. **Test Docker Build Locally**:
   ```bash
   # Build all services
   docker-compose build

   # Run in foreground to see logs
   docker-compose up

   # Or run in background
   docker-compose up -d

   # Check logs
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

2. **Test Application**:
   - Backend: http://localhost:8004/docs
   - Frontend: http://localhost:8501 (or http://localhost:3004 via nginx-helper)

3. **Deploy to Azure**: Follow DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md section "Scenario 4: Azure Web App Deployment"

## Feature 3: Fallback Document with Tracked Changes

**Branch**: `feat/fallback-tracked-changes`
**Status**: ✅ Merged to dev

### Problem Solved

Enable uploading a fallback DOCX file with tracked changes, which are automatically extracted and applied to the main document. This provides:
- Faster processing (bypasses LLM)
- More accurate results (direct application of known changes)
- Author attribution preservation
- Two modes: tracked changes (preferred) or requirements text (fallback)

### Files Created

1. **FALLBACK_TRACKED_CHANGES.md**
   - Complete feature documentation (500+ lines)
   - Usage examples for UI and API
   - Technical details and data structures
   - Edge cases and troubleshooting
   - FAQ and example use cases

### Files Modified

1. **backend/word_processor.py** (Major additions)
   - **Added import**: `from dataclasses import dataclass`
   - **New TrackedChange dataclass** (lines 31-58):
     ```python
     @dataclass
     class TrackedChange:
         change_type: str  # "insertion", "deletion", "substitution"
         old_text: str
         new_text: str
         author: str
         date: str
         paragraph_index: int
         context_before: str = ""
         context_after: str = ""
     ```
   - **New function extract_tracked_changes_structured()** (lines 289-434):
     - Parses Word XML for w:ins and w:del elements
     - Detects substitutions by pairing deletions with insertions
     - Extracts 50 characters of context before/after each change
     - Returns List[TrackedChange]
   - **New function convert_tracked_changes_to_edits()** (lines 436-459):
     - Converts TrackedChange objects to edit dictionaries
     - Compatible with process_document_with_edits() format

2. **backend/main.py**
   - **Updated imports** (lines 30-32):
     ```python
     extract_tracked_changes_structured,
     convert_tracked_changes_to_edits,
     TrackedChange
     ```
   - **Modified /process-document-with-fallback/ endpoint** (lines 524-687):
     - Detects tracked changes in fallback document after file save
     - If tracked changes found:
       - Extracts and converts to edits
       - Skips LLM processing
       - Sets `using_tracked_changes = True`
     - If no tracked changes:
       - Falls back to existing Phase 2.1/2.2 requirements extraction
       - Uses LLM to generate edits
     - Updated status messages to indicate method used:
       - "from tracked changes" vs "based on fallback document"

3. **frontend/streamlit_app.py**
   - **Updated fallback checkbox help text** (lines 47-51):
     ```python
     help="Upload a second document that contains:\n"
          "• Tracked changes to apply to the main document (preferred), OR\n"
          "• Requirements/guidance text for AI to interpret\n\n"
          "If the fallback document has tracked changes, they will be extracted and applied directly!"
     ```
   - **Added explanation section** (lines 60-65):
     - Explains tracked changes mode vs requirements mode
     - Clarifies that both can work together

### Key Technical Decisions

- **TrackedChange dataclass**: Clean separation of concerns with structured data
- **Substitution detection**: Intelligently pairs deletions with following insertions
- **Context preservation**: 50 characters before/after for accurate matching in main document
- **Automatic mode detection**: System chooses best approach based on fallback content
- **LLM bypass**: Direct application when tracked changes present (faster, cheaper, more accurate)
- **Backward compatibility**: Falls back to requirements mode seamlessly

### How It Works

1. **Upload Phase**:
   - User uploads main DOCX and fallback DOCX
   - Backend saves both files temporarily

2. **Detection Phase**:
   - `extract_tracked_changes_structured()` scans fallback document
   - Looks for w:ins and w:del XML elements
   - If found, extracts as TrackedChange objects

3. **Processing Phase**:
   - **Tracked Changes Mode**:
     - Convert to edit dictionaries
     - Apply directly to main document
     - Skip LLM (faster, more accurate)
   - **Requirements Mode**:
     - Extract requirements text
     - Use Phase 2.1/2.2 logic
     - LLM generates edits

4. **Application Phase**:
   - Changes applied as tracked revisions
   - Author attribution from original changes
   - Context-aware matching for accuracy

### What to Do Next

1. **Test with Example Files**:
   ```bash
   # Use test files in tests/ directory
   # Look for .docx files with tracked changes
   find tests/ -name "*.docx" -type f
   ```

2. **Via Streamlit UI**:
   - Upload a main document
   - Check "Use fallback document for guidance"
   - Upload a fallback document with tracked changes
   - Process and observe status message
   - Should say "from tracked changes" if detected

3. **Via API** (example in Python):
   ```python
   import requests

   files = {
       'input_file': open('main.docx', 'rb'),
       'fallback_file': open('fallback_with_changes.docx', 'rb')
   }

   data = {
       'user_instructions': '',
       'author_name': 'AI Reviewer',
       'case_sensitive': True,
       'add_comments': True
   }

   response = requests.post(
       'http://localhost:8004/process-document-with-fallback/',
       files=files,
       data=data
   )

   result = response.json()
   print(f"Status: {result['status_message']}")
   print(f"Method: {result.get('processing_method', 'Unknown')}")
   ```

4. **Check Debug Output**:
   - Enable "Standard Debugging" in Streamlit UI
   - Look for messages indicating tracked changes were found
   - Verify count of insertions, deletions, substitutions

## Troubleshooting

### NGINX Issues
- **404 Not Found**: Check that BASE_URL_PATH matches NGINX location
- **WebSocket errors**: Verify proxy_http_version and Upgrade headers
- **Static assets fail**: Check baseUrlPath configuration

See NGINX_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md for detailed troubleshooting.

### Docker Issues
- **Container won't start**: Check logs with `docker-compose logs [service]`
- **Backend unreachable**: Verify service names and network configuration
- **Port conflicts**: Change ports in docker-compose.yml

See DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md for detailed troubleshooting.

### Fallback Tracked Changes Issues
- **Tracked changes not detected**: Enable debug mode and check logs
- **Changes don't match**: Verify main and fallback documents have similar structure
- **Some changes not applied**: Check processing log for matching failures

See FALLBACK_TRACKED_CHANGES.md for detailed troubleshooting.
