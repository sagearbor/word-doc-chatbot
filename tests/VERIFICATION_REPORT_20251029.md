# LLM Connection Verification Report
**Date:** 2025-10-29 02:14 UTC
**Test:** Golden Dataset Baseline Tests
**Goal:** Verify .env fix resolved 0 edits issue

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

âœ… **ISSUE RESOLVED** - The LLM is now generating edit suggestions successfully!

### Before Fix (Previous Run)
- **Edits suggested:** 0 for all test cases
- **Edits applied:** 0 for all test cases
- **Root cause:** Quoted environment variables in .env file prevented Azure OpenAI API authentication

### After Fix (This Run)
- **Case 01:** 7 edits suggested, 5 applied (71% application rate)
- **Case 02:** 2 edits suggested, 2 applied (100% application rate)
- **Case 03:** 0 edits suggested (using different endpoint - /process-document/)

## DETAILED RESULTS

### Test Case 01: Service Agreement Tightening
```
Input: case_01_input_service_agreement.docx
Fallback: case_01_fallback_requirements.docx
Endpoint: /process-document-with-fallback/

Results:
  - Edits suggested by LLM: 7
  - Edits successfully applied: 5
  - Edits failed to apply: 2
  - Application success rate: 71.4%

Expected vs Actual:
  - Expected changes: 10
  - Actual changes: 5
  - Success rate: 50.0%
  - Missed changes: 5

Status: Processing complete. 5 out of 7 changes based on fallback document were applied.
```

**Analysis:**
- LLM is generating relevant edits
- Good application rate (5 out of 7 = 71%)
- Gap between expected (10) and suggested (7) indicates:
  - LLM may need prompt tuning to catch all requirements
  - Some requirements may not be extractable from fallback

### Test Case 02: Complex Contract Editing
```
Input: case_02_input_service_agreement.docx
Fallback: case_02_fallback_comprehensive_guidelines.docx
Endpoint: /process-document-with-fallback/

Results:
  - Edits suggested by LLM: 2
  - Edits successfully applied: 2
  - Edits failed to apply: 0
  - Application success rate: 100%

Expected vs Actual:
  - Expected changes: 9
  - Actual changes: 2
  - Success rate: 22.2%
  - Missed changes: 7

Status: Processing complete. All 2 changes based on fallback document were applied.
```

**Analysis:**
- LLM is working but only generating 2 edits vs 9 expected
- Perfect application rate (2/2 = 100%)
- Significant gap suggests:
  - Fallback requirements extraction needs improvement
  - LLM prompt may need refinement
  - Possible issue with comprehensive guidelines parsing

### Test Case 03: Existing Tracked Changes Preservation
```
Input: case_03_input_with_existing_changes.docx (with 8 existing tracked changes)
Prompt: case_03_prompt_additional_edits.txt
Endpoint: /process-document/

Results:
  - Edits suggested by LLM: 0
  - Edits successfully applied: 0
  - Existing tracked changes preserved: 8 (verified in analysis)

Status: N/A
```

**Analysis:**
- Different endpoint used (/process-document/ vs /process-document-with-fallback/)
- 0 edits suggests LLM may not be processing the text prompt correctly
- Existing changes were detected successfully (8 tracked changes found)
- Needs investigation - may be prompt formatting issue

## TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Environment Fix Applied
**Problem:** Quoted values in .env file
```bash
# BEFORE (BROKEN)
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="7f123..."
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://dukeaiservices4.openai.azure.com/"

# AFTER (FIXED)
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=7f123...
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://dukeaiservices4.openai.azure.com/
```

### Docker Container Rebuild
```bash
docker stop word-chatbot-sveltekit
docker rm word-chatbot-sveltekit
docker build -f Dockerfile.sveltekit -t word-chatbot:sveltekit .
docker run -d -p 3004:8000 --env-file .env --name word-chatbot-sveltekit word-chatbot:sveltekit
```

### Test Script Fixes
1. **Proxy bypass:** Added `session.trust_env = False` to prevent JupyterHub proxy interference
2. **API key corrections:** Fixed `edits_suggested_count` â†’ `edits_suggested`, `edits_applied_count` â†’ `edits_applied`

---

## LLM API VERIFICATION

### Sample LLM Response (from Docker logs)
```json
{
  "edits": [
    {
      "contextual_old_text": "A simple file seeing if tracked changes program can work.  It should change this sentence...",
      "specific_old_text": "A simple file seeing if tracked changes program can work.",
      "specific_new_text": "A test document seeing if tracked changes system functions correctly.",
      "reason": "Update terminology for clarity"
    }
    // ... 2 more edits
  ]
}
```

**Confirmation:** LLM is returning structured JSON with proper edit format.

---

## REMAINING ISSUES

### 1. Test Script Error (Low Priority)
```python
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable (line 339)
```
- Test script crashes after Case 03
- Does not affect LLM functionality
- Fix: Add None check before accessing result['status']

### 2. Lower Than Expected Edit Count (Medium Priority)
- **Case 01:** 7 suggested vs 10 expected
- **Case 02:** 2 suggested vs 9 expected
- **Case 03:** 0 suggested (prompt-based test)

**Possible causes:**
- Requirements extraction from fallback documents incomplete
- LLM prompt needs tuning for comprehensiveness
- Expected counts may not match actual requirements in fallback docs

### 3. Text Matching Failures (Medium Priority)
- **Case 01:** 2 out of 7 edits failed to apply (71% success)
- **Case 02:** 0 out of 2 edits failed (100% success)

**Note:** This is actually pretty good! The fuzzy matching logic is working well. Case 01's 2 failures may be due to:
- Text variations in the document
- Whitespace/formatting differences
- Context mismatches

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Next Steps
1. âœ… **DONE:** Verify LLM connection working
2. **NEXT:** Investigate why Case 03 generates 0 edits
   - Check if /process-document/ endpoint handles text prompts correctly
   - Review prompt formatting in case_03_prompt_additional_edits.txt
3. **NEXT:** Analyze why edit counts are lower than expected
   - Review fallback document requirements extraction logic
   - Check LLM prompt for comprehensive instruction coverage
4. **Optional:** Fix test script None error (line 339)

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Prompt Engineering:** Tune LLM prompts to capture all requirements
2. **Requirements Extraction:** Improve parsing of fallback documents
3. **Test Expectations:** Validate that expected counts match actual requirements in fallback docs
4. **Fuzzy Matching:** Already working well (71-100% application rates)

---

## CONCLUSION

**PRIMARY GOAL ACHIEVED:** The .env fix successfully resolved the "0 edits" issue. The LLM is now:
- âœ… Connecting to Azure OpenAI API
- âœ… Generating structured edit suggestions
- âœ… Producing relevant changes based on requirements
- âœ… Achieving 71-100% application success rates

The remaining issues are related to **prompt tuning and requirements extraction**, not LLM connectivity.
