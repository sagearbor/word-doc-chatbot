# Hypothesis 1: LLM Response Investigation - FINDINGS

## Test Case: case_02_contract_editing

### Summary
**HYPOTHESIS CONFIRMED**: The LLM IS returning a detailed response, but it's being lost/corrupted somewhere in the processing chain.

### Evidence

#### 1. LiteLLM Raw Response (Source of Truth)
**File**: `/tmp/litellm_raw_response.txt`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ LLM returned SUCCESSFUL response
- **Length**: 27KB of detailed content
- **Tokens**: 1648 completion tokens, 598 prompt tokens
- **Model**: gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07
- **Response Type**: 15 numbered conditional instructions

**Sample Content**:
```
1. Check if the agreement specifies a project completion timeframe. If no completion timeframe or a different timeframe is present, replace or add the clause exactly with: "The Contractor must complete all work within 30 business days of project start."...

2. Search for acceptance and deliverable approval language. If the document does not require client approval prior to final acceptance...

[...15 detailed instructions total...]
```

#### 2. get_chat_response() Output
**File**: `/tmp/get_llm_analysis_response.txt`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Successfully extracted
- **Length**: 2603 characters
- **Format**: JSON with structured requirements
- **Content**: 4 requirements with proper structure

**This is from a DIFFERENT LLM call** (earlier in the workflow for requirement extraction).

#### 3. Final Output from extract_conditional_instructions_with_llm()
**File**: `/tmp/llm_response_hypothesis1.txt`
- **Status**: ‚ùå CORRUPTED - Response reduced to empty braces
- **Length**: Only 2 characters: `{}`
- **Problem**: The detailed 27KB response was converted to `{}`

### Root Cause Analysis

**The Bug Location**: Between `get_llm_analysis()` returning the response and `extract_conditional_instructions_with_llm()` processing it.

Looking at the code flow:
1. `litellm.completion()` returns full response ‚úÖ
2. `ai_client.chat_completion()` extracts `response.choices[0].message.content` ‚úÖ
3. `get_llm_analysis()` receives the full content ‚úÖ
4. **SOMEWHERE HERE** the response gets corrupted to `{}`
5. `extract_conditional_instructions_with_llm()` receives `{}`

### Potential Cause

The LLM is returning **conditional instructions** format (numbered list), but the code may be:
1. Trying to parse it as JSON (and failing, returning `{}`)
2. Running through a JSON validation that strips non-JSON content
3. Being processed by a function expecting different format

### Test Results
- **Edits suggested**: 8
- **Edits applied**: 0
- **Reason**: All edits failed with `CONTEXT_NOT_FOUND` because the conditional instructions were lost and the fallback regex approach was used instead

### Next Steps

1. **Investigate**: Look for JSON parsing between `get_llm_analysis()` and the final return
2. **Hypothesis 2**: There's a JSON.parse() or similar call that's silently failing
3. **Hypothesis 3**: The response format isn't matching expected structure
4. **Fix**: Either:
   - Remove JSON parsing if not needed
   - Update prompt to return valid JSON
   - Add error handling to preserve original response on parse failure

### Logs for Review
- Full LLM response: `/tmp/litellm_raw_response.txt`
- Intermediate response: `/tmp/get_llm_analysis_response.txt`
- Final corrupted output: `/tmp/llm_response_hypothesis1.txt`
- Backend logs: `/tmp/backend_logs.txt`

### Status
üîç **PARTIALLY SOLVED**: We know the LLM IS returning data and WHERE it's being lost. Need to identify the exact line/function that corrupts it to `{}`.
