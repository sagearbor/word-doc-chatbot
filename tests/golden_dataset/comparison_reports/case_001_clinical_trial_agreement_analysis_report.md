# Test Case Analysis Report
        
## Test Case: case_001_clinical_trial_agreement
**Description:** Clinical trial agreement fallback document processing test case
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-21T15:29:18.201591

## Document Paths
- **Input Document:** /mnt/c/Users/scb2/Documents/GitHub/word-doc-chatbot/tests/golden_dataset/input_documents/starting_doc_with_tracked_changes.docx
- **Fallback Document:** /mnt/c/Users/scb2/Documents/GitHub/word-doc-chatbot/tests/golden_dataset/fallback_documents/clinical_trial_fallback.docx  
- **Expected Output:** /mnt/c/Users/scb2/Documents/GitHub/word-doc-chatbot/tests/golden_dataset/expected_outputs/desired_edited_document.docx

## Document Differences Analysis

            Analyze the following three legal documents to understand what changes should be applied:

            1. INPUT DOCUMENT: Starting document that needs to be modified
            2. FALLBACK DOCUMENT: Contains minimum requirements that should be applied
            3. EXPECTED OUTPUT: Shows how the document should look after applying fallback requirements

            Please provide a detailed markdown analysis with:
            
            ## Required Changes Analysis
            - List specific changes that need to be made to transform input â†’ expected output  
            - Identify which fallback requirements drive each change
            - Highlight any conflicts or complex requirements
            
            ## Fallback Requirements Translation
            - Extract key requirements from fallback document
            - Convert requirements into clear, actionable instructions
            - Prioritize requirements by legal importance
            
            ## Expected Outcomes
            - Summarize what the final document should contain
            - Note any formatting or structural changes needed
            - Identify critical legal language that must be preserved
            
            This analysis will be used to test and improve automated fallback document processing.
