# Case 02 Diagnosis - LLM Returning 0 Edits

## Test Results

**Test Date**: 2025-10-27
**Test Case**: case_02_contract_editing
**Status**: ‚ùå FAILED - LLM generated 0 edits (expected 9)

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ What's Working
1. **Timeout fix**: Increased from 120s to 300s - no more timeout errors
2. **Requirements extraction**: "‚úÖ Found requirements from fallback document"
3. **Backend processing**: No crashes or errors
4. **Phase 2.1 execution**: Using "Phase 2.1 Enhanced Instructions" successfully

### ‚ùå The Problem
- **Requirements found**: YES (fallback document analyzed correctly)
- **LLM received instructions**: YES
- **LLM generated edits**: NO (returned 0 edits)

## Test Output

```

## Root Cause Analysis

The system is correctly extracting requirements from the fallback document and passing them to the LLM, but the LLM is deciding that NO edits are needed. This could be because:

### Hypothesis 1: Instructions Are Too Abstract
The fallback document requirements are:
- Insurance requirement ($1M professional liability)
- IP ownership clause
- Record retention (7 years)
- Monthly status reports
- Quality assurance testing
- Confidentiality prohibitions
- Conflict of interest restrictions
- Subcontracting restrictions

These are **new additions** that don't have direct text to replace in the input document. The input document has generic clauses like:
- "Payment terms are flexible and can be negotiated"
- "Documentation may be provided if requested"
- "The Contractor may use subcontractors at their discretion"

The LLM might be interpreting the fallback requirements as **additions** rather than **replacements**, and since it can only generate replacements (not insertions), it returns 0 edits.

### Hypothesis 2: Instruction Format Issue
The LLM prompt might not be clear that it should:
1. REPLACE generic text with specific requirements
2. SUBSTITUTE vague language with precise language
3. FIND the closest matching text to replace

### Hypothesis 3: LLM Model Limitations
The current AI provider/model might be:
- Too conservative in suggesting edits
- Not understanding the task correctly
- Requiring a different prompt format

## Next Steps - CRITICAL

### 1. **Check Backend Terminal Output** (MOST IMPORTANT)

You need to look at your backend terminal where `uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8888` is running.

Look for these key log sections:

```
üß† Using intelligent LLM-based fallback analysis...
üîç Extracting conditional analysis instructions from fallback document...
Generated fallback instructions:
[This will show what instructions were created]

Combined instructions length: XXXX characters
[This shows what was sent to the LLM]

üìä DETAILED LLM SUGGESTIONS ANALYSIS
[This shows what the LLM returned]
```

**Copy and save** the following from your backend logs:
1. The generated fallback instructions
2. The combined instructions sent to LLM
3. The LLM's response

### 2. Try Disabling LLM-Based Extraction

Test if the regex-based extraction works better:

```bash
# Add to backend/legal_document_processor.py line 872
USE_LLM_EXTRACTION = False  # Change from True to False
```

Then restart backend and re-run:
```bash
python tests/run_baseline_tests.py
```

### 3. Test with Simpler Fallback Document

Create a test with 1-2 simple requirements:

```
tests/test_cases/case_02_simple/fallback/simple_fallback.docx:
---
Contract Requirements:

1. MUST: Change "flexible" to "net 30 days"
2. SHALL: Change "may be provided if requested" to "shall be provided weekly"
```

This will test if the issue is with complex/abstract requirements.

### 4. Check LLM Provider Configuration

```bash
# Check current LLM config
curl http://127.0.0.1:8888/llm-config/
```

Verify:
- Which AI provider is being used (Azure OpenAI, etc.)
- Which model is configured
- If API keys are valid

### 5. Review the LLM Prompt Template

Check `backend/llm_handler.py` to see what prompt is being sent to the LLM when processing fallback documents. The prompt might need to be more explicit about handling abstract requirements.

## Comparison with Case 01

**Case 01 worked** (10/10 edits generated) with this fallback:
- "Change vague 'should' to 'must'"
- "Change 'weekly' to 'biweekly'"
- Specific text replacements

**Case 02 failed** (0/9 edits generated) with this fallback:
- "Provider must obtain insurance of $1M"
- "IP shall be owned by Client"
- Requirements that need **insertion** not **replacement**

The key difference: **Case 01 had direct text to replace**, Case 02 requires **new clauses to be added**.

## Recommended Fix

The system needs to be enhanced to handle requirements that require **insertion** of new clauses, not just replacement of existing text. This requires:

1. **Detection**: Identify when a requirement has no matching text in input document
2. **Location**: Determine WHERE to insert the new clause (which section)
3. **Format**: Generate appropriate XML to insert new paragraphs

Alternatively, simplify Case 02 to only test text **replacements** that have direct matches:

```
Simplified Case 02 fallback:
1. Change "flexible and can be negotiated" to "net 30 days payment"
2. Change "may be provided if requested" to "shall be provided monthly"
3. Change "may use subcontractors at their discretion" to "must not subcontract without written consent"
```

## Files Modified

- `tests/run_baseline_tests.py` - Timeout fixed (120s ‚Üí 300s) ‚úÖ
- `tests/run_baseline_tests.py` - Case 03 API parameters fixed ‚úÖ

## Status

- **Fixes applied**: ‚úÖ Timeout and API parameters
- **Issue identified**: ‚úÖ LLM returning 0 edits despite finding requirements
- **Root cause**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires backend log analysis
- **Solution**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Pending user review of backend logs

---

**Next Action**: Copy the backend terminal logs showing the fallback instruction generation and LLM prompt/response for case_02.
