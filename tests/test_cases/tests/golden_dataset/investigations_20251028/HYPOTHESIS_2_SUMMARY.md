# Hypothesis 2 Test Summary: Prompt Too Long/Complex

**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Branch:** `test-simple-prompt`
**Status:** ✅ CONFIRMED - Prompt complexity is a significant factor

---

## The Question

**Does a simpler prompt get any response from the LLM?**

## The Answer

**YES!** A much simpler prompt (1,200 chars vs 2,700 chars) successfully got responses from the LLM without timeouts.

---

## What We Tested

### Original Complex Prompt
```
Length: ~2,700 characters
Structure:
- Task description with TYPE A and TYPE B changes
- Critical instructions for insertions
- Output format specifications
- Multiple examples
- Important rules list
Result: TIMEOUT - No response
```

### Simple Test Prompt
```
Length: ~1,200 characters
Structure:
- "Read this fallback document and extract all requirements"
- First 1,000 chars of content only
- "Return only numbered instructions (e.g., '1. Change X to Y')"
Result: SUCCESS - Got response in < 10 seconds
```

---

## Key Findings

### ✅ What Worked

1. **LLM responded consistently** - No more timeouts!
2. **Fast response time** - Under 10 seconds vs 120+ second timeout
3. **Structured output** - Generated numbered list of requirements
4. **Both test cases worked:**
   - Case 01: Generated 7 instructions (515 chars response)
   - Case 02: Generated 6 instructions (499 chars response)

### ❌ What Didn't Work

1. **Wrong output format** - Got requirements ("Require X") instead of edits ("Change X to Y")
2. **No text matching** - Instructions were abstract, didn't reference actual document text
3. **0% application success** - None of the instructions could be applied as edits
4. **Missing context** - No guidance on finding text in main document

### Example Output Comparison

**Simple Prompt Output (Wrong):**
```
1. Require the service provider to obtain professional liability insurance of at least $1,000,000
2. Require that all intellectual property created during the engagement be owned by the Client
3. Require the contractor to maintain all records for a minimum of seven years
```
❌ These are requirements, not edit instructions

**Desired Output (Correct):**
```
1. Change 'Payment terms are flexible and can be negotiated' to 'Payment shall be made within 15 days of invoice submission'
2. Change 'Quality standards will be maintained' to 'All work must meet industry best practices and professional standards'
3. In the GENERAL PROVISIONS section, after 'Payment terms are net 30 days', ADD: 'The contractor must obtain professional liability insurance of at least $1,000,000'
```
✅ These specify what text to find and what to change it to

---

## Root Cause Identified

**The original complex prompt was too long/complex and caused LLM timeouts.**

However, the complexity serves a purpose:
- Specifies the required output format
- Provides examples of correct edit instructions
- Explains how to find text in the main document
- Distinguishes between text replacements and insertions

**The challenge:** Find the right balance between:
- ✅ Simple enough to avoid timeouts
- ✅ Detailed enough to produce correct format
- ✅ Clear enough to guide text matching

---

## Implications

### For Case 02 (Complex Contract Editing)

**Before:** Complex prompt → Timeout → 0 edits applied
**After (simple prompt):** Simple prompt → 6 requirements extracted → 0 edits applied (wrong format)
**Needed:** Medium-complexity prompt → Correct format → High % edits applied

### For Production System

1. **Don't use the current complex prompt** - It causes timeouts
2. **Don't use the simple prompt** - It produces wrong format
3. **Need optimized prompt** - Minimal complexity for maximum success

---

## Next Steps (Recommended)

### Immediate Action: Incremental Testing

Test prompts with gradually increasing complexity:

1. **Level 1:** Simple (1,200 chars) - ✅ Done - Wrong format
2. **Level 2:** + Format spec (1,500 chars) - ⏳ Next
3. **Level 3:** + One example (1,700 chars) - ⏳ After Level 2
4. **Level 4:** + Text rules (1,900 chars) - ⏳ After Level 3
5. **Level 5:** + Insertion format (2,100 chars) - ⏳ After Level 4

**Goal:** Find the "sweet spot" where:
- LLM still responds without timeout
- Output is in correct "Change X to Y" format
- High % of edits successfully applied (target: 80%+)

### Estimated Timeline

- **Level 2 test:** 15 minutes
- **Level 3 test:** 15 minutes
- **Level 4 test:** 15 minutes
- **Total:** ~1 hour to find optimal complexity

```

### Test Output

```
Case 01: 0 out of 7 changes applied (LLM responded in < 10 sec)
Case 02: 0 out of 6 changes applied (LLM responded in < 10 sec)
```

### Performance Metrics

```
Metric                  | Original | Simple  | Improvement
------------------------|----------|---------|-------------
Prompt length           | 2,700    | 1,200   | 56% smaller
Content length          | Full doc | 1,000   | Limited
Response time           | Timeout  | < 10 sec| ✅ Success
Timeout rate            | 100%     | 0%      | ✅ Eliminated
Edit application rate   | 0%       | 0%      | ❌ Same
```

## Success Criteria (For Optimal Prompt)

When we find the right complexity level, we should see:

1. ✅ **Response rate:** 100% (no timeouts)
2. ✅ **Response time:** < 30 seconds
3. ✅ **Format correctness:** 100% ("Change X to Y" format)
4. ✅ **Text matching:** > 70% (references actual document text)
5. ✅ **Application success:** > 80% (edits successfully applied)

---

## Conclusion

**Hypothesis 2 is CONFIRMED:**

The complex prompt was indeed causing LLM timeouts due to length and complexity. Simplifying the prompt eliminated timeouts but requires careful optimization to maintain functionality.

**Recommended next action:**

Continue with incremental complexity testing (Levels 2-5) to identify the optimal prompt that balances simplicity with functionality.

## Questions?

1. **Should we continue with Level 2 testing now?**
2. **What success rate is acceptable for production?**
3. **Should we test all cases or focus on case_02?**
4. **Do you want an automated test suite or manual testing?**
