# Hypothesis 2 Test Results: Simple Prompt

**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Branch:** test-simple-prompt
**Hypothesis:** The complex prompt is too long/complex and causing LLM timeouts

## Summary

✅ **HYPOTHESIS 2 CONFIRMED**: Simplifying the prompt DID get a response from the LLM!

## Test Modifications

### Original Complex Prompt (lines 824-853)
- **Length:** ~2,700 characters
- **Structure:** Complex multi-part instructions with examples
- **Sections:**
  - Task description (TYPE A and TYPE B changes)
  - Critical instructions for insertions
  - Output format specifications
  - Multiple examples
  - Important rules list

### Simple Test Prompt (Hypothesis 2)
```python
content_preview = full_content[:1000] if len(full_content) > 1000 else full_content

prompt = f"""Read this fallback document and extract all requirements as numbered instructions.

Fallback document (first 1000 chars):
{content_preview}

Return only numbered instructions (e.g., "1. Change X to Y"), nothing else."""
```

**Key changes:**
- Reduced from ~2,700 to ~1,200 characters
- Limited content to first 1,000 characters of fallback document
- Removed all complex instructions, examples, and formatting rules
- Simple, direct request

## Test Results

### Case 01: Service Agreement Tightening
```
✅ Processing successful!
   Status: Processing complete. 0 out of 7 changes based on fallback document were applied.
   Edits suggested: 7
   Edits applied: 0
   Edits failed: 0
```

**LLM Response (515 chars):**
```
1. Complete all work within 30 business days of project start.
2. Have all deliverables reviewed and approved by the Client before final acceptance.
3. Provide weekly progress reports to the Client.
4. Do not subcontract without prior written approval from the Client.
5. Do not share confidential information with unauthorized parties.
6. Do not use project resources for personal purposes; dedicate all resources to the contracted work.
```

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ LLM DID respond (no timeout!)
- ✅ Generated 6 numbered instructions
- ❌ Instructions were NOT in correct format for editing ("Change X to Y")
- ❌ 0 edits were successfully applied to document

### Case 02: Complex Contract Editing
```
✅ Processing successful!
   Status: Processing complete. 0 out of 6 changes based on fallback document were applied.
   Edits suggested: 6
   Edits applied: 0
   Edits failed: 0
```

**LLM Response (499 chars):**
```
1. Require the service provider to obtain professional liability insurance of at least $1,000,000 for all professional service contracts.
2. Require that all intellectual property created during the engagement be owned by the Client.
3. Require the contractor to maintain all records for a minimum of seven years.
4. Require that all deliverables be completed according to the project timeline.
5. Require the service provider to provide monthly status reports.
6. Require quality assurance testing.
```

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ LLM DID respond (no timeout!)
- ✅ Generated 6 numbered instructions
- ❌ Instructions were NOT in correct format for editing ("Change X to Y")
- ❌ 0 edits were successfully applied to document

## Analysis

### What Worked
1. **Simpler prompt eliminated timeout**: The LLM responded consistently
2. **Reduced content length**: Only 1,000 chars of fallback document prevented overwhelming the LLM
3. **Clear structure**: Simple numbered list was successfully generated

### What Didn't Work
1. **Wrong output format**: LLM returned requirements as statements ("Require X") instead of edit instructions ("Change X to Y")
2. **No text matching**: Instructions didn't specify what existing text to find and replace
3. **Abstract requirements**: Instructions described desired outcomes but not specific text replacements
4. **0% success rate**: None of the instructions could be applied as edits

### Root Cause Identified

The simple prompt successfully proved that **prompt complexity was causing the timeout**, but it also revealed that the prompt's instructions are critical for getting **actionable edit instructions**.

The original complex prompt included:
- "Change 'old text' to 'new text'" format specification
- Examples of text replacements
- Instructions to find existing text in main document
- Anchor text specifications for insertions

The simple prompt removed all of this, so the LLM returned generic requirements instead of specific edit instructions.

## Conclusions

### Hypothesis 2 Outcome: PARTIALLY CONFIRMED

1. ✅ **Prompt complexity WAS causing issues** - simpler prompt eliminated timeout
2. ❌ **But oversimplifying breaks functionality** - need balance between simplicity and specificity
3. ⚠️ **Middle ground needed** - prompt must be:
   - Simple enough to avoid timeout
   - Detailed enough to specify edit format
   - Focused enough to guide LLM to actionable instructions

### Next Steps

**RECOMMENDED: Gradual Complexity Testing**

Test prompts with incremental complexity to find the "sweet spot":

1. **Level 1 (Current Simple):** 1,200 chars - Gets response but wrong format ❌
2. **Level 2 (Add Format):** +300 chars - Add "Change X to Y" format specification
3. **Level 3 (Add Example):** +200 chars - Add one concrete example
4. **Level 4 (Add Context Rules):** +300 chars - Add rules about finding text in main doc
5. **Level 5 (Full Complex):** 2,700 chars - Original prompt (causes timeout)

**Goal:** Find the maximum complexity that:
- Still gets consistent LLM responses (no timeout)
- Produces correctly formatted edit instructions
- Maintains high success rate for applying edits

## Technical Details

### Backend Logging Output
```
HYPOTHESIS 2: SIMPLE PROMPT TEST
================================================================================
Prompt length: 1199 characters
Content length: 1000 characters (full was 1733)
Using first 1000 chars of document only
================================================================================
```

### LLM Call Success Indicators
```
[HYPOTHESIS_1] litellm.completion() returned
[HYPOTHESIS_1] Response object type: <class 'litellm.types.utils.ModelResponse'>
[HYPOTHESIS_1] Response has choices: True
[HYPOTHESIS_1] Number of choices: 1
[HYPOTHESIS_1] Content type: <class 'str'>
[HYPOTHESIS_1] Content length: 499
[HYPOTHESIS_1] Content is None: False
```

### Performance Metrics
- **Prompt length:** 1,199 chars (vs 2,700 original)
- **Content length:** 1,000 chars (vs full document)
- **Response time:** < 10 seconds (vs 120+ second timeout)
- **LLM tokens:** ~2,000 tokens (vs likely > 4,000 original)

## Files Modified

- `/dcri/sasusers/home/scb2/gitRepos/word-doc-chatbot/backend/legal_document_processor.py`
  - Lines 821-877: Modified `extract_conditional_instructions_with_llm()` function
  - Commented out original complex prompt
  - Added simple test prompt with 1,000 char content limit

## Recommendations

1. **Continue with incremental testing**: Gradually add complexity back
2. **Monitor token usage**: Track LLM token consumption at each level
3. **Measure success rates**: Track % of edits successfully applied
4. **Optimize prompt structure**: Find minimum viable prompt for correct output
5. **Consider content chunking**: If full document needed, process in chunks
