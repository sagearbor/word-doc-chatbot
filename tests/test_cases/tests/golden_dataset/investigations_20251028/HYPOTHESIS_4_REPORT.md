# Hypothesis 4: Azure OpenAI Model Limitation Test Report

## Date: 2025-10-28

## Hypothesis
Test if a more powerful model (GPT-4o) handles complex fallback documents better than gpt-5-mini.

## Test Setup

### Models Tested
1. **gpt-5-mini** (default) - Azure OpenAI deployment
2. **gpt-4o** - Azure OpenAI deployment (overridden in code)

### Test Document
- File: `tests/golden_dataset/fallback_documents/c1_mock_fallBack.docx`
- Type: Legal contract (mock clinical trial agreement)
- Content: 3505 characters main text

### Code Changes
Modified `backend/legal_document_processor.py`:
- Added `model` parameter to `get_llm_analysis()` function
- Created test script to monkey-patch model selection for comparison
- No changes to prompts (used existing Hypothesis 2 simplified prompt)

## Results

### Instruction Generation Count
| Model | Instructions Generated | Length |
|-------|----------------------|--------|
| gpt-5-mini | **7 instructions** | 995 characters |
| gpt-4o | **3 instructions** | 342 characters |

### Detailed Comparison

**gpt-5-mini output (7 instructions):**
```
1. Insert the Effective Date as "the date of the last signature hereon"
2. Identify and insert the Study Site's legal name in blank
3. Identify and insert the Study Site's full address in blank
4. Retain Duke University's description
5. Specify Party references
6. Require Study Site to conduct Study per Protocol
7. Require compliance with federal guidelines
```

**GPT-4o output (3 instructions):**
```
1. Conduct the Study in strict accordance with the Protocol
2. Adhere to all applicable local, state, and federal guidelines
3. Comply with US state and federal regulations
```

### Quality Analysis

**gpt-5-mini advantages:**
- ✅ More granular and specific instructions
- ✅ Captures structural requirements (blanks, dates, names)
- ✅ Comprehensive coverage of document elements
- ✅ More actionable "fill in the blank" style instructions

**GPT-4o advantages:**
- ✅ More concise and high-level
- ✅ Focuses on compliance requirements
- ✅ Less verbose
- ⚠️ May miss structural details

## Conclusion

### ❌ HYPOTHESIS 4: NOT CONFIRMED

**The more powerful GPT-4o model does NOT generate more instructions than gpt-5-mini.**

In fact, gpt-5-mini generated more than twice as many instructions (7 vs 3).

### Key Findings

1. **Model intelligence is NOT the bottleneck**
   - Both models successfully generated instructions
   - Both understood the task and produced valid outputs

2. **Prompt strategy matters more than model power**
   - The simplified prompt (Hypothesis 2) works on both models
   - The difference is in interpretation style, not capability

3. **gpt-5-mini may be better suited for this task**
   - More detailed extraction of requirements
   - Better at capturing structural elements
   - More granular output

4. **Different models have different styles**
   - gpt-5-mini: Detailed, structural, literal interpretation
   - GPT-4o: High-level, abstracted, compliance-focused

### Implications

**This finding suggests that:**
- The original problem is NOT a model limitation
- Previous hypotheses about prompt length and complexity are more likely correct
- We should focus on **prompt engineering** rather than model selection
- gpt-5-mini is actually well-suited for this task when given proper prompts

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ **Keep using gpt-5-mini** - it's working well with the right prompts
2. ✅ **Focus on Hypothesis 2 and 3** - prompt design is the real issue
3. ❌ **Don't switch to GPT-4** - not necessary and may reduce detail

### Future Testing
1. Test with different prompt variations on gpt-5-mini
2. Optimize for gpt-5-mini's strengths (detailed extraction)
3. Consider using GPT-4 only for higher-level analysis tasks

- Seed: 42 (reproducible)
- Max tokens: 2000

### Files Modified
- `backend/legal_document_processor.py` (added model parameter to get_llm_analysis)
- Created test scripts for comparison

- Individual test: `/tmp/hypothesis4_test.log`

## Related Hypotheses

- **Hypothesis 1**: Empty LLM responses - Related to how we process responses
- **Hypothesis 2**: Simplified prompts work better - **CONFIRMED and applies to both models**
- **Hypothesis 3**: Document length limitations - May still be relevant
- **Hypothesis 4**: Model limitation - **NOT CONFIRMED** (this report)

## Next Steps

Based on these findings, recommended next steps:
1. Continue with gpt-5-mini as the default model
2. Focus on refining the simplified prompt from Hypothesis 2
3. Test prompt variations to maximize gpt-5-mini's detailed extraction capabilities
4. Investigate why original complex prompts failed (Hypothesis 3)
