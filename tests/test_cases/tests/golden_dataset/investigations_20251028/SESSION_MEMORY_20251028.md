## Critical Findings

### ‚úÖ Case 02 Simplified: WORKING
- **Created**: `case_02_fallback_SIMPLIFIED.docx` with 4 direct text replacements
- **Result**: 4 edits generated, 3 applied successfully
- **Proof**: System works! LLM can generate and apply edits from fallback requirements

### ‚ùå Case 02 Complex: FAILING (Priority #1 to fix)
- **Fallback**: `case_02_fallback_comprehensive_guidelines.docx` (abstract requirements)
- **Result**: 0 edits generated
- **Root Cause**: AI Call #1 (fallback analyzer) returns empty results (line 28-30 in logs)
- **Why**: LLM doesn't know how to convert abstract requirements (insurance, IP, record retention) into specific insertion instructions
- **Fix Needed**: Enhance AI Call #1 prompt in `backend/legal_document_processor.py:extract_conditional_instructions_with_llm()`

### ‚úÖ Case 03: WORKING (Priority #2 resolved)
- **Status**: HTTP 200 - SUCCESS
- **Resolution**: Fixed API parameter names in run_baseline_tests.py (input_file‚Üífile, user_instructions‚Üíinstructions)
- **Result**: System correctly handles documents with existing tracked changes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Sequential Edit Issue (User's Important Question)
**User is RIGHT to question this!**

**What happened** (from logs line 236):
- Edit #1 changed paragraph 3: "Payment terms are flexible and can be negotiated" ‚Üí "Payment terms are net 30 days payment"
- Edit #2 tried to find context: "The Contractor will provide services to the Client... The Contractor may use subcontractors at their discretion. Payment terms are flexible and can be negotiated."
- **FAILED**: Context not found because edit #1 changed "Payment terms are flexible..." which was IN the context

**User's Correct Insight**:
- The system has `specific_old_text`: "The Contractor may use subcontractors at their discretion."
- The system has `contextual_old_text` with surrounding text for uniqueness
- **The specific_old_text didn't change** - it should still be findable!

**Real Problem** (in backend/word_processor.py):
The word processor requires the **full contextual_old_text** to match before applying an edit. If a previous edit changed ANY part of that context (even text outside the specific_old_text), it rejects the edit with "CONTEXT_NOT_FOUND".

**Solution**: The word processor should:
1. Use contextual_old_text to locate the general area
2. But then search for specific_old_text within a reasonable range
3. Don't require the FULL context to match exactly after previous edits

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `tests/run_baseline_tests.py`: Timeouts 120s‚Üí300s, case_03 API params fixed

### Files Created
- `tests/test_cases/case_02_contract_editing/fallback/case_02_fallback_SIMPLIFIED.docx`
- `tests/test_cases/TEST_RESULTS_20251028.md`: Comprehensive analysis
- `tests/test_cases/SESSION_MEMORY_20251028.md`: This file

### Backend Info
- **PID**: 1336478
- **Port**: 8888
- **Logs**: /tmp/backend_logs.txt
- **Started**: Oct 28 02:07

### Key Code Locations

**AI Call #1 (needs fix)**:
- File: `backend/legal_document_processor.py`
- Function: `extract_conditional_instructions_with_llm()` around line 769-809
- Issue: Returns empty for abstract requirements
- Logs show: Line 28 "üéØ Conditional analysis response length: 0 characters"

**Sequential Edit Issue**:
- File: `backend/word_processor.py`
- Logic: Requires full contextual_old_text match before applying edit
- Location: Around lines processing LLM context matching
- Issue: Rejects edits when previous edits changed context

## Next Actions (User's Priority Order)

1. **Compact session** ‚úÖ (this file)
2. **Debug case_03** (Priority #2) ‚úÖ RESOLVED
   - HTTP 200 success after API parameter fixes
   - Documentation updated
3. **Fix complex case_02** (Priority #1) ‚úÖ **ROOT CAUSES FOUND AND FIXED!**
   - **Hypothesis 3 Fix** ‚úÖ: Import error (`from .ai_client` failed silently) - Fixed with fallback import
   - **Hypothesis 5 Fix** ‚úÖ: Token exhaustion (max_tokens=2000‚Üí4000) - LLM used all tokens on reasoning
   - **Hypothesis 1 Finding**: Downstream CONTEXT_NOT_FOUND bug (same as sequential edit issue)
   - **Files Modified**: backend/legal_document_processor.py:901-905, 912
   - **Status**: Ready for testing
4. **Fix sequential edit issue** (Priority #2 - IDENTIFIED IN HYPOTHESIS 1)
   - **Problem**: LLM generates edits correctly, but ALL fail with CONTEXT_NOT_FOUND
   - **Root Cause**: After edit #1 changes paragraph, edit #2's contextual_old_text no longer matches
   - **Solution Needed**: Word processor should find specific_old_text even when context changed
   - **File**: backend/word_processor.py (context matching logic)
   - **Next Step**: Modify to search for specific_old_text within proximity, not require exact context match

## Test Results Summary

| Case | Status | Edits Gen | Applied | Issue |
|------|--------|-----------|---------|-------|
| 01 | ‚úÖ Pass | - | - | Previously completed |
| 02-Simple | ‚úÖ Pass | 4 | 3 | 1 failed due to context issue |
| 02-Complex | ‚ùå Fail | 0 | 0 | AI Call #1 returns empty |
| 03 | ‚úÖ Pass | - | - | Working after API param fix |

## Key Log Evidence

**Simplified fallback SUCCESS** (lines 59-86):
```
üìù Full user instructions:
2. Change 'payment terms are flexible and can be negotiated' to 'payment terms are net 30 days payment'
9. Change 'may use subcontractors at their discretion' to 'must not subcontract without written consent'
12. Change 'should maintain confidentiality' to 'must maintain strict confidentiality'
```

**Complex fallback FAILURE** (lines 28-30):
```
üéØ Conditional analysis response length: 0 characters
‚ùå LLM returned empty conditional analysis
```

**Sequential edit FAILURE** (line 236):
```
P3: Current visible paragraph text (len 205): 'The Contractor will provide services...'
P3: LLM Context 'The Contractor will provide se...' not found in paragraph text.
P3: Edit skipped - CONTEXT_NOT_FOUND for 'The Contractor may use subcontractors at their discretion.'
```
Note: The specific_old_text still exists in the paragraph, but the contextual_old_text contains "Payment terms are flexible..." which was changed by edit #1.
