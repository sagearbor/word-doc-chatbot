# Hypothesis 5 Root Cause: GPT-5-mini Reasoning Tokens Exhaustion

## Executive Summary

**CONFIRMED:** Case 02 fails because GPT-5-mini exhausts its token budget on internal reasoning before producing output, resulting in empty responses that break the fallback processing pipeline.

## The Problem

### What We Found
When processing the comprehensive fallback document, the LLM returns an **empty response** despite appearing to complete successfully:

```
[HYPOTHESIS_1] Content length: 0
[HYPOTHESIS_1] finish_reason='length'
[HYPOTHESIS_1] reasoning_tokens=2000
[HYPOTHESIS_1] completion_tokens=2000
LLM response length: 0 characters
LLM extracted 0 requirements
```

### Root Cause: Reasoning Token Exhaustion

GPT-5-mini uses internal "reasoning tokens" for complex tasks. The API call shows:
- `max_tokens=2000` configured in ai_client.py
- `reasoning_tokens=2000` used by model
- `completion_tokens=2000` (all used for reasoning)
- `finish_reason='length'` (hit token limit)
- **`content=''` (empty output)**

The model exhausts all 2000 tokens on internal reasoning before generating any JSON output, resulting in an empty response that breaks the requirements extraction pipeline.

## Impact Chain

### 1. Empty LLM Response
```python
# requirements_processor.py extracts 0 requirements
LLM extracted 0 requirements
Found 0 raw requirements to process
```

### 2. No Fallback Requirements Available
```python
# instruction_merger.py has nothing to merge
Step 1: Processing fallback requirements...
Processed 0 requirements with 0 conflicts detected
```

### 3. Only User Instructions Processed
```python
# Only the vague user instruction is used
Step 2: Parsing user instructions...
Parsed 5 user instructions from input
```

### 4. LLM Generates Generic Edits
Without specific fallback guidance, the LLM makes generic edits like:
- "flexible" → "fixed and non-negotiable" (instead of "net 30 days payment")
- Missing specific requirements from comprehensive fallback

### 5. Test Case Fails
Expected edits don't match actual edits because fallback requirements were never extracted.

## Why Simplified Fallback Works

The simplified fallback document:
- Uses direct "REQUIREMENT: Change X to Y" format
- Shorter content (724 chars vs 1548 chars)
- Less complex structure requiring less reasoning
- LLM successfully returns 2603 char response with 4 requirements

## Evidence

### Comprehensive Fallback Processing Log
```
Extracted document content: 1548 chars main text
[AI_CLIENT_DEBUG] Adjusting temperature from 0.0 to 1.0 for GPT-5 model
[AI_CLIENT_DEBUG] max_tokens': 2000
[HYPOTHESIS_1] finish_reason='length'
[HYPOTHESIS_1] reasoning_tokens=2000
[HYPOTHESIS_1] completion_tokens=2000
[HYPOTHESIS_1] Content length: 0
```

### API Response Object
```python
Choices(
    finish_reason='length',  # Hit token limit!
    message=Message(
        content='',  # Empty output!
        role='assistant'
    )
)
usage=Usage(
    completion_tokens=2000,  # All tokens used
    reasoning_tokens=2000    # All for reasoning
)
```

## Solutions

### Option 1: Increase max_tokens (Immediate Fix)
Update `ai_client.py` to increase token limit for requirement extraction:

```python
# In ai_client.py - get_chat_response_raw()
if model_name and 'gpt-5' in model_name.lower():
    # Allow more tokens for complex reasoning tasks
    if max_tokens == 2000:
        max_tokens = 4000  # Double the limit for GPT-5
```

This allows GPT-5-mini to complete reasoning AND produce output.

### Option 2: Bypass LLM for Structured Fallbacks (Better Architecture)
The legal_document_processor already successfully extracts 8 requirements from the comprehensive fallback using regex patterns. Instead of sending to LLM:

```python
# In requirements_processor.py
def process_fallback_document_requirements(doc_path):
    # Try structured extraction first
    legal_parser = LegalDocumentParser()
    structure = legal_parser.parse_legal_document(doc_path)

    if len(structure.requirements) > 0:
        # Use regex-extracted requirements (no LLM needed!)
        return format_legal_requirements_for_processing(structure.requirements)
    else:
        # Fall back to LLM extraction for unstructured text
        return llm_based_extraction(doc_path)
```

This is more reliable, faster, and doesn't burn tokens on reasoning.

### Option 3: Use Different Model
Switch to GPT-4 or Claude for complex requirement extraction (more expensive but more reliable).

### Option 4: Simplify Prompt
Reduce the complexity of the requirement extraction prompt to require less reasoning:
- Remove verbose examples
- Focus on pattern matching rather than interpretation
- Split into multiple simpler calls

## Recommended Immediate Action

**Implement Option 2** - Bypass LLM extraction for structured documents:

1. The legal_document_processor already works (extracts 8 requirements correctly)
2. No need for expensive LLM calls for structured legal documents
3. More reliable and deterministic
4. Faster processing

**As backup, implement Option 1** - Increase max_tokens to 4000+ for GPT-5-mini calls to prevent token exhaustion.

## Test Case Modifications Needed

After implementing the fix, Case 02 should work with the comprehensive fallback. However, the expected outputs may need updating because the comprehensive fallback contains different requirements than the simplified version:

### Comprehensive Fallback Requirements (8 total):
1. Professional liability insurance ($1M)
2. IP ownership by client
3. 7-year record retention
4. Timeline compliance
5. Monthly status reports
6. QA testing for software
7. Confidentiality restrictions
8. Conflict of interest prohibition
9. Subcontracting restrictions

### User Instructions (4 areas):
1. Payment terms specificity
2. Regular reporting
3. Subcontracting restrictions
4. Confidentiality strengthening

The overlap is limited - the comprehensive fallback doesn't directly address payment terms, so the merged instructions should include BOTH the 8 fallback requirements AND the user's 4 areas, resulting in more extensive edits than the simplified version.

## Verification Steps

1. Implement Option 2 (bypass LLM for structured docs)
2. Re-run case_02 with comprehensive fallback
3. Verify 8 requirements extracted from fallback
4. Verify merged instructions include both fallback + user requirements
5. Update expected_output.docx to match comprehensive + user merged edits
6. Run automated tests to confirm fix

## Conclusion

The case_02 failure is **not** due to:
- ❌ Document corruption
- ❌ Malformed DOCX files
- ❌ Invalid XML structure
- ❌ Encoding issues

It **is** due to:
- ✅ GPT-5-mini exhausting 2000 token budget on reasoning
- ✅ Empty LLM response breaking requirements extraction
- ✅ No fallback requirements available for instruction merging
- ✅ Generic edits generated from vague user instructions alone

The fix is straightforward: either increase token limits or bypass LLM extraction for structured legal documents (preferred approach).
