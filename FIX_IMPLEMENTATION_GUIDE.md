# Quick Implementation Guide: Fix CONTEXT_AMBIGUOUS Failures

**Estimated Time:** 2-4 hours (including testing)
**Complexity:** Low
**Risk:** Minimal
**Files Changed:** 1 file, ~5 lines

---

## Step 1: Apply the Core Fix (10 minutes)

### File: `/dcri/sasusers/home/scb2/gitRepos/word-doc-chatbot/backend/word_processor.py`

**Location:** Lines 313-315 in function `extract_tracked_changes_structured()`

**Current Code:**
```python
for para_idx, paragraph in enumerate(doc.paragraphs):
    # Build a map of the paragraph content to get context
    para_text = paragraph.text  # ‚Üê THIS IS THE PROBLEM

    # Track position in paragraph for context extraction
    current_pos = 0
```

**Fixed Code:**
```python
for para_idx, paragraph in enumerate(doc.paragraphs):
    # Build a map of the paragraph content to get context
    # Use same extraction method as process_document_with_edits for consistency
    para_text, _ = _build_visible_text_map(paragraph)

    # Track position in paragraph for context extraction
    current_pos = 0
```

**Why this works:**
- Ensures context extraction uses the same method as context matching
- Both phases now use `_build_visible_text_map()` consistently
- Handles tracked changes in both documents identically

---

## Step 2: Add a Comment Explaining the Fix (2 minutes)

Add this comment above the change:

```python
for para_idx, paragraph in enumerate(doc.paragraphs):
    # CRITICAL: Must use _build_visible_text_map() for consistency with
    # process_document_with_edits(). Using paragraph.text creates mismatch
    # when documents contain tracked changes, causing CONTEXT_AMBIGUOUS failures.
    # See: CONTEXT_AMBIGUOUS_ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS.md
    para_text, _ = _build_visible_text_map(paragraph)
```

---

## Step 3: Test with JEx2 Documents (30-60 minutes)

### Test Command:
```bash
cd /dcri/sasusers/home/scb2/gitRepos/word-doc-chatbot

# Option 1: Test via API endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/process-document-with-fallback/ \
  -F "main_file=@tests/golden_dataset/dcri_examples/JEx2_CTA_INPUT_redlineFromSite.docx" \
  -F "fallback_file=@tests/golden_dataset/dcri_examples/JEx2_CTA_FALLBACK_byDcri.docx" \
  -F "user_instructions=Apply all changes from fallback" \
  -F "debug_mode=true"

# Option 2: Test directly with Python
python3 << 'EOF'
import sys
sys.path.append('/dcri/sasusers/home/scb2/gitRepos/word-doc-chatbot')

from backend.word_processor import (
    extract_tracked_changes_structured,
    convert_tracked_changes_to_edits,
    process_document_with_edits
)

# Extract changes from fallback
fallback_path = "tests/golden_dataset/dcri_examples/JEx2_CTA_FALLBACK_byDcri.docx"
tracked_changes = extract_tracked_changes_structured(fallback_path)
print(f"Extracted {len(tracked_changes)} tracked changes")

# Convert to edits
edits = convert_tracked_changes_to_edits(tracked_changes)
print(f"Converted to {len(edits)} edits")

# Apply to main document
main_path = "tests/golden_dataset/dcri_examples/JEx2_CTA_INPUT_redlineFromSite.docx"
result = process_document_with_edits(
    main_path,
    "test_output.docx",
    edits,
    debug_mode=True
)

print(f"\nResult: {result}")
EOF
```

### Expected Results (Success Criteria):

**Before Fix:**
```
Applied: 0
CONTEXT_AMBIGUOUS: 11
SPECIFIC_TEXT_NOT_FOUND: 0
```

**After Fix (Target):**
```
Applied: 9-11  (82-100% success)
CONTEXT_AMBIGUOUS: 0-2  (only legitimate ambiguities)
SPECIFIC_TEXT_NOT_FOUND: 0
```

### What to Check:
1. ‚úÖ Number of successfully applied edits increases dramatically
2. ‚úÖ CONTEXT_AMBIGUOUS count drops to near zero
3. ‚úÖ Output document contains tracked changes in correct locations
4. ‚úÖ No crashes or exceptions
5. ‚úÖ Processing time remains reasonable (< 10% slower)

---

## Step 4: Run Regression Tests (1-2 hours)

### Test Suite:
```bash
# Run all word processor tests
pytest tests/test_word_processor.py -v

# Run golden dataset tests
pytest tests/golden_dataset_tests.py -v

# Run main API tests
pytest tests/test_main.py -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=backend/word_processor --cov-report=html
```

### Expected Results:
- ‚úÖ All existing tests pass (no regressions)
- ‚úÖ Code coverage remains high (>80%)
- ‚úÖ No new failures introduced

### If Tests Fail:
1. Check if test expected values need updating (they may expect old behavior)
2. Verify the failure is not a genuine regression
3. Update test expectations if new behavior is correct

---

## Step 5: Edge Case Testing (Optional but Recommended, 30 minutes)

Test with various document types:

```bash
# Create test documents with:
# - Only tracked changes (no comments)
# - Only comments (no tracked changes)
# - Both tracked changes and comments
# - Multiple authors
# - Nested changes
```

Example test cases:
1. **Simple insertion:** Single word insertion with clear context
2. **Simple deletion:** Single word deletion
3. **Substitution:** Word replacement
4. **Empty paragraph:** Tracked change in empty paragraph
5. **Large insertion:** Multi-sentence insertion
6. **Multiple changes per paragraph:** Several changes close together

---

## Step 6: Performance Testing (Optional, 30 minutes)

Measure performance impact:

```python
import time
from backend.word_processor import extract_tracked_changes_structured

doc_path = "tests/golden_dataset/dcri_examples/JEx2_CTA_FALLBACK_byDcri.docx"

# Time the extraction
start = time.time()
for _ in range(10):
    changes = extract_tracked_changes_structured(doc_path)
end = time.time()

avg_time = (end - start) / 10
print(f"Average extraction time: {avg_time:.3f} seconds")
```

**Acceptable Performance:**
- Extraction time should be < 1 second for typical documents
- At most 10% slower than previous implementation
- No memory leaks or excessive memory usage

---

## Step 7: Update Documentation (15 minutes)

### File: `FALLBACK_TRACKED_CHANGES.md`

Add a section explaining the extraction method:

```markdown
## Technical Implementation Details

### Text Extraction Consistency

The system uses `_build_visible_text_map()` for all text extraction to ensure consistency:

1. **Context extraction** (from fallback document): Uses `_build_visible_text_map()`
2. **Context matching** (in main document): Uses `_build_visible_text_map()`

This consistency is critical because:
- Documents with tracked changes have multiple text representations
- `paragraph.text` produces different output than `_build_visible_text_map()`
- Using different methods causes context mismatch and CONTEXT_AMBIGUOUS failures

**Example:** A paragraph with tracked changes:
- `paragraph.text`: "...and _____________, located at _______________..."
- `_build_visible_text_map()`: "...and _ University of North Carolina..., located at Tarheel Road..."

Using inconsistent methods would cause context extracted from fallback to never match in main document.
```

## Step 8: Commit Changes (10 minutes)

```bash
cd /dcri/sasusers/home/scb2/gitRepos/word-doc-chatbot

# Stage changes
git add backend/word_processor.py

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "fix: Resolve CONTEXT_AMBIGUOUS failures in fallback document processing

- Use _build_visible_text_map() consistently in both extraction and application phases
- Previously used paragraph.text for extraction and _build_visible_text_map() for matching

- Fixes 0/11 success rate issue with JEx2 real-world test case
- Add comprehensive root cause analysis documentation

Resolves: CONTEXT_AMBIGUOUS failures for documents with tracked changes
Impact: Increases success rate from 0% to 82-100% for real-world cases
Files changed: backend/word_processor.py (1 line)
Testing: Verified with JEx2_CTA documents, all regression tests pass
